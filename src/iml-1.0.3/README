IML: Integer Matrix Library

IML package provides efficient routines to solve nonsingular systems of 
linear equations, certified solve any shape systems of linear equations, 
and perform mod p matrix operations, such as computing row-echelon form, 
determinant, rank profile, inverse of a mod p matrix.

See INSTALL for the installation instructions.
See doc/liblink for how to link your program with the library.
See doc/libroutines for routine reference.
See examples/readme for how to compile the examples
